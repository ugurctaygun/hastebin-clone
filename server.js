const code = `# Haste

Sharing code is a good thing, and it should be _really_ easy to do it.
A lot of times, I want to show you something I'm seeing - and that's where we
use pastebins.

Haste is the prettiest, easiest to use pastebin ever made.

## Basic Usage

Type what you want me to see, click "Save", and then copy the URL.  Send that
URL to someone and they'll see what you see.

To make a new entry, click "New" (or type 'control + n')`;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.render("code-display", { code });
});

app.listen(3000);
